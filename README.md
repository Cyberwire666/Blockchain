# TokenVesting Smart Contract

## Overview

`TokenVesting` is a Solidity smart contract that implements a standard token vesting mechanism. It allows tokens to be gradually released to a beneficiary address based on a cliff and vesting period. The vesting can optionally be revoked by the contract owner.

This contract is designed for use with ERC20-compatible tokens and ensures secure token distribution over time for investors, teams, or stakeholders.

## Features

- **Linear Vesting**: Gradual release of tokens over a specified duration.
- **Cliff Period**: Tokens cannot be released until the cliff time has passed.
- **Revocable Vesting**: Owner can revoke the vesting if allowed.
- **ERC20 Compatible**: Uses SafeERC20 for secure token transfers.

|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `release(token)` | Transfers vested tokens to the beneficiary            |
| `revoke(token)`  | Allows the owner to revoke unvested tokens            |
| `beneficiary()`  | Returns the beneficiary address                       |

| `duration()`     | Returns the total duration                            |
| `revocable()`    | Returns true if vesting is revocable                  |
| `released(token)`| Returns amount of token already released              |
| `revoked(token)` | Returns true if the token has been revoked            |
